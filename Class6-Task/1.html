        The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

        title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
        studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
        rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
        a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.



        class movie {
        constructor(title, studio, rating) {
          this.title = title;
          this.studio = studio;
          this.rating = rating;
        }
      
        getrating() {
          return "the rating is  " + this.rating;
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-js">b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.


        class movie {
            constructor(title, studio, rating){
                this.title = title;
                this.studio = studio;
                this.rating = "PG";
            }
        }

        

      </code></pre>

      <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-js">c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.


        getPG{
            return this.rating;
        }
      </code></pre>

      <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-js">d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

        const CasinoRoyale = new movie( "Casino Royal", "Eon Productions", "PG13");
